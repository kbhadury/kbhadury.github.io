				<h1>Hi!</h1>
				<p>
				My name is Kiran Bhadury, and I'm currently a backend software developer at Workday in Pleasanton, California.  I graduated with a B.S. in computer science and engineering from the University of California, Davis (where I also <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/one-unique-job-tractor-driving-instructor/">learned</a> how to drive a tractor).
				<br>
				<br>
				During summer 2018 I interned on the Web Services Framework team at Workday, and for the summer of 2017 I interned at LitePoint in Sunnyvale, California, as a software developer on the manufacturing team.  I also worked at UC Davis as a calculus tutor for the Academic Assistance and Tutoring Center, as a student assistant in the IT department at the Office of Research, and as the Technical Director for the 105th Picnic Day - one of the largest student-run events in the country.
				<br>
				<br>
				I enjoy biking around the Bay Area, going on hikes with friends and family, and baking desserts to undo any effects from that exercise.

				<h1>Featured projects</h1>
				<p>
				These are some of my favorite projects that I've worked on.  Most of them, <a href="https://github.com/kbhadury/kbhadury.github.io">including this website</a>, are on GitHub.

							<span class="projecttitle">Fill</span><br>
							Fill is a minimalist puzzle game about filling in spaces. The first ten levels guide you through the game mechanics, and after that the levels are randomly generated forever.  So play some relaxing music, kick off your shoes, and navigate your way through the shapeshifting grids.  How far can you get?

							<span class="projecttitle">Relativity</span><br>
							In sophomore year of college I took a class on modern physics. We learned about Einstein's theory of relativity, which involves lengths increasing and time slowing down. It's mind bending stuff, so I made an interactive website that helps visualize the equations behind the theory.

							My friends and I moved into an off-campus apartment for sophomore year and we needed to split up rent and utility costs. I'd been wanting to learn web development, and I figured making a website to divide costs would be a fun way to get started.

							<span class="projecttitle">Ray tracer</span><br>
							This is my take on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_box">Cornell Box</a> using a ray tracer I built for a computer graphics course. Notice the lensing caused by the glass sphere and how the front wall is reflected in the yellow sphere.  I learned a ton about graphics and object-oriented programming from this project, and it's easily one of my favorites.

							The pattern shown here is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve">Dragon curve</a>, which is a type of fractal. I'm not much of an artist, but there are rules known as "Lindenmayer systems" which make it easy for computers to draw fractals. My program interprets those rules to create all kinds of interesting patterns (check the GitHub page for more pictures!)

							<span class="projecttitle">Hilbert</span><br>
							I spent a few months teaching myself OpenGL, and to practice using it I created a 3D version of my LSystem project. Working in three dimensions was a challenge, but I really enjoyed the flexibility it offered. The image here shows a fractal plant made out of pyramids, and there are more renderings on the GitHub page.

				<h1>Employment</h1>
				<p>
					I've had the opportunity to explore a few different roles as a software engineer, from data analysis and visualization to tech support and troubleshooting.  I also tutored calculus at UC Davis for three years and led a team of assistants as the Technical Director for Picnic Day at UC Davis.  I'm looking forward to whatever comes next!

It also provides support for the latest third-party software. After completing that project, I developed a Windows app in C# to generate equipment serial numbers.

				<h1>Research</h1>
				<p>
				I previously worked on an agricultural research team at UC Davis.  Our project involved using drones to evaluate crops' health, and our team included mechanical engineers, biologists, and software developers.  In the software group, we worked on developing a neural network using Google's <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> along with MATLAB in order to analyze data collected by the drone.  The project was <a href="http://www.abc10.com/news/local/davis/drones-helping-to-fight-mites-in-strawberry-almond-fields/446347500">featured on local news</a>!
				</p>
				<p>
				I also participated in the <a href="https://microgravityuniversity.jsc.nasa.gov/nasasuits.cfm">NASA SUITS</a> competition as part of the UC Davis team.  We worked with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens">Microsoft HoloLens</a> to develop an augmented reality user interface for astronauts.  Currently, all instructions during spacewalks are communicated between the astronaut and mission control by voice, and NASA is looking to develop helmet-based visual communication systems.  Our goal was to find an intuitive and effective way to present data to astronauts during spacewalks by using augmented reality.  We spent 5 months developing our project and then spent a week at Johnson Space Center in Houston 
				testing our project with NASA engineers.

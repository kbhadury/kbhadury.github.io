				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<p>
				My name is Kiran Bhadury, and I'm a junior studying computer science and engineering at the University of California, Davis.  I'm interested in computer graphics, and I also  enjoy tutoring for my university's math and physics courses.  During summer 2017 I worked at LitePoint in Sunnyvale, California, as a software developer in the manufacturing team.  I've also worked as a calculus tutor for the UC Davis Student Academic Success Center and as a student assistant in the IT department at the UC Davis Office of Research.
				<br>
				<br>
				I enjoy biking around Davis and the Bay Area, going on hikes with friends and family, and baking desserts to undo any effects from that exercise.

				<h1>Featured projects</h1>
				<p>
				These are some of my favorite projects that I've worked on.  Most of them, <a href="https://github.com/kbhadury/kbhadury.github.io">including this website</a>, are on GitHub.

							<span class="projecttitle">Relativity</span><br>
							In sophomore year of college I took a class on modern physics. We learned about Einstein's theory of relativity, which involves lengths increasing and time slowing down. It's mind bending stuff, so I made an interactive website that helps visualize the equations behind the theory.

							<span class="projecttitle">RentMate</span><br>
							My friends and I moved into an off-campus apartment for sophomore year and we needed to split up rent and utility costs. I'd been wanting to learn web development, and I figured making a website to divide costs would be a fun way to get started.

							<span class="projecttitle">Ray tracer</span><br>
							This is my take on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_box">Cornell Box</a> using a ray tracer I built for a computer graphics course. Notice the lensing caused by the glass sphere and how the front wall is reflected in the yellow sphere.  I learned a ton about graphics and object-oriented programming from this project, and it's easily one of my favorites.

							<span class="projecttitle">LSystem</span><br>
							The pattern shown here is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve">Dragon curve</a>, which is a type of fractal. I'm not much of an artist, but there are rules known as "Lindenmayer systems" which make it easy for computers to draw fractals. My program interprets those rules to create all kinds of interesting patterns (check the GitHub page for more pictures!)

							<span class="projecttitle">Hilbert</span><br>
							I spent a few months teaching myself OpenGL, and to practice using it I created a 3D version of my LSystem project. Working in three dimensions was a challenge, but I really enjoyed the flexibility it offered. The image here shows a fractal plant made out of pyramids, and there are more renderings on the GitHub page.

							<p>
							<span class="projecttitle">Market.cpp</span><br>
							This was an assignment for a class on data structures and algorithms. Given lists of buyers and sellers, we had to simulate one million stock market transactions.  My program used hash tables, heaps, and binary trees and processed all transactions in under 0.5 seconds, which was faster than the professor's benchmark.

				<h1>Employment</h1>
				<p>
					Both my previous jobs emphasized tech support and troubleshooting, and I've also been tutoring math at UC Davis since freshman year.  Whether it's a perplexed person or a puzzled PC, I'll gladly lend a hand.

							<span class="employertitle">Software Engineering Co-op, LitePoint</span><br>
							I migrated LitePoint's software from Visual Studio 2008/.NET 3.5 to 2015/.NET 4.6.1, creating a development platform they can use for the next five years. It also provides support for the latest third-party software. On the side, I developed a Windows app in C# to generate equipment serial numbers.

							I spent one year of college in the IT department at the UC Davis Office of Research. I troubleshooted Windows and Linux systems, set up new workstations and other hardware, and managed inventory. To speed up inventory management, I wrote a script to pull data from the PC manufacturers' websites into Excel.

				<h1>Research</h1>
				<p>
				I'm currently part of an agricultural research team at UC Davis.  The project involves using drones to evaluate crops' health, and our team includes mechanical engineers, biologists, and software developers.  In the software group, we're developing a neural network using Google's <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> along with MATLAB in order to analyze data collected by the drone.  The project was <a href="http://www.abc10.com/news/local/davis/drones-helping-to-fight-mites-in-strawberry-almond-fields/446347500">featured on local news</a>!
				</p>
				<p>
				I'm also participating in the <a href="https://microgravityuniversity.jsc.nasa.gov/nasasuits.cfm">NASA SUITS</a> competition as part of the UC Davis team.  We're working with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens">Microsoft HoloLens</a> to develop an augmented reality user interface for astronauts.  Currently, all instructions during spacewalks are communicated between the astronaut and mission control by voice, and NASA is looking to develop helmet-based visual communication systems.  Our goal is to find an intuitive and effective way to present data to astronauts during spacewalks by using augmented reality.
